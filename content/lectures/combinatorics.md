## Synopsis

Many problems involve combinatorial reasoning.  Today we will talk about four
sequences that come up: Fibonacci, Binomial Coefficients, Derangements, and Catalan Numbers.

## Recommended Reading

 - Competitive Programming 4, Section 5.4

## Videos

 - [Basic Combinatorics]({{% ref "/videos/basic-combinatorics" %}})

## Problem

 - {{<UVa id="1482" name="10541 - Stripe" >}}   Note that 50 digits requires 166 bits.  You probably want Python or Java.
