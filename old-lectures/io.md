## Synopsis

Today's topic is somewhat easy; we are going to talk about input and output.
In normal programming you can use libraries that are convenient, but in some cases
you will get TLE if you use the wrong one.  (We're looking at you, `cin`!)

Since the video, I have learned there are some commands you can type to speed up `cin`.

We will also talk about ad-hoc problem solving.
Sometimes you don't need a general algorithm to solve a problem, you just
need to code.  These are the "ad-hoc" problems.
